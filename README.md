The codes have been implemented using Jupyter Hub and Google Earth Engine. The codes are jointly updated by Dewan Mohammad Enamul Haque, Dewan Ruksana Ruma, and Mashfiqur Shattique
Leveraging Sentinel 2A imagery, GEDI LiDAR biomass data, and ESAâ€™s Biomass products, we estimated AGB for three key periods: 2017 (pre-refugee influx), 2019 (early forest restoration), and 2023 (restoration progress). We employed machine learning regression models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression. 

I. 2017 Pre-refugee Influx

| Type              | Code                                           |

II. 2019 (early forest restoration) & 2023 (restoration progress)

| Type                     | Code                                           |

Installation Instruction for Jupyter Environment:
A .yml file is provided in order to create a Python environment using conda. This environment can be created by running:

conda env create -f PY02_agb.yml

If this command executes correctly and finishes without errors, it should print out instructions on how to activate and deactivate the new environment. To activate the environment, use:

conda activate PY02_agb

To deactivate the environment, use:

conda deactivate
